### <a name="overview"></a> Overview 

This script dynamically generates an `index.html` file and a `script.js` file, which together create a basic webpage for playing audio files stored in a `tracks` directory. 

### <a name="modules"></a> Modules

The script uses the following modules:

| Module  | Description |
|---|---|
| `fs` | Node.js file system module for reading and writing files. |
| `path` | Node.js path module for working with file and directory paths. |
| `pageElements` |  A custom module containing variables `htmlStart`, `htmlEnd`, `jsStart`, and `jsEnd`. This module is assumed to contain HTML and JavaScript code snippets for the header and footer of the generated webpage. |
| `process` | Node.js process module for accessing and managing the current Node.js process. (This line is only needed for older Node.js versions.)|

### <a name="functions"></a> Functions

The script does not define any custom functions. It uses `fs.readdir` and `fs.writeFile` to read and write files.

### <a name="variables"></a> Variables

The following variables are used in the script:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `files` |  An array of filenames obtained from the `tracks` directory. |
| `htmlText` | A string variable that accumulates the HTML content for the `index.html` file. |
| `jsText` | A string variable that accumulates the JavaScript content for the `script.js` file. |
| `fileId` |  A string variable representing the filename without the file extension, derived from each file in the `files` array. |

### <a name="file-handling"></a> File Handling

The script utilizes the `fs` module to handle file interactions. 

1. **Reading directory contents:**
    * The script uses `fs.readdir` to read the contents of the `tracks` directory.
    * If an error occurs while reading the directory, an error message is printed to the console and the script exits with a non-zero exit code.

2. **Generating HTML and JavaScript content:**
    * The script iterates through the `files` array using `forEach`.
    * For each file, it extracts the file ID (filename without extension).
    * It constructs HTML code for an input checkbox, a label, and an audio element, adding these to the `htmlText` variable.
    * It constructs JavaScript code for a function call `playIfChecked`, adding this to the `jsText` variable.
    * The `playIfChecked` function is assumed to be defined in the `script.js` file, and is responsible for playing the audio file associated with the checked checkbox.

3. **Writing output files:**
    * Once the HTML and JavaScript code is generated, the script uses `fs.writeFile` to write the content to `index.html` and `script.js` files respectively.
    * If an error occurs during file writing, an error message is printed to the console. 

The script dynamically constructs a simple webpage with checkboxes for each audio file in the `tracks` directory, allowing the user to select and play the desired audio files.
